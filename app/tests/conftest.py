"""Shared test fixtures.

Two big things to set up:
  1. An isolated state.json per test (no leakage between tests, no
     clobbering of the user's real `app/state.json`).
  2. A stub OFF client so the nutrition resolver can be exercised
     without hitting the public network.

The FastAPI `TestClient` runs the app's `lifespan` hook, which calls
`init_state(path)` — so pointing `STATE_PATH` at a temp file is enough
to get a clean state per test.
