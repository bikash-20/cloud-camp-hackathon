"""Tesseract OCR wrapper — optional fallback for the vision stub.

Disabled by default. Activate via the `OCR_ENABLED=true` env var;
the system also needs `pytesseract` (pip) AND the Tesseract binary on
the host (`brew install tesseract` on macOS, `apt install tesseract-ocr`
on Debian). When any of those are missing, every function in this
module degrades gracefully to a no-op rather than crashing the route.
